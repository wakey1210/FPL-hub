# FPL Hub

A personal Fantasy Premier League assistant: a transparent, free prediction
engine plus a mobile-first PWA styled like the official FPL app. Built to
replace a mix of tools (Ben Crellin's transfer-planning sheet, Fantasy
Football Hub's paid AI picker) with something self-hosted, auditable, and
free to run.

**Live app:** https://wakey1210.github.io/FPL-hub/

## Why

Commercial FPL "AI" pickers are black boxes - no published methodology, no
accuracy tracking, no explanation of *why* a player is rated highly. This
project does the opposite: every prediction ships with an uncertainty band
and a plain-English breakdown of what drove it, and the model's real
gameweek-by-gameweek error will be tracked in-app once the season starts.

## Architecture

```
/engine   Python: fetches the official FPL API, builds a transparent expected-
          points (EV) model, and runs a linear-programming optimiser for
          squad/transfer suggestions. Outputs JSON.
/data     Committed JSON output from the engine (latest-overwrite, not
          per-run snapshots, to keep repo size bounded).
/app      React + TypeScript + Tailwind PWA that reads /data/*.json and
          renders it - pitch view, transfers list, fixture planner.
```

Everything runs free on GitHub:
- **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/pipeline.yml`) fetches data and
  recomputes predictions every 3 hours (or on demand via
  `workflow_dispatch`), committing the results to `/data`.
- **GitHub Pages** (`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`) rebuilds and
  redeploys the static PWA whenever `/app` or `/data` changes.

There's no backend server: the FPL API doesn't send CORS headers, so the
browser can never call it directly - the Actions pipeline does that fetching
server-side and the app just reads the resulting same-origin JSON files.

## The model (v1)

For each player, over the next 6 gameweeks:

```
EV = appearance points (from expected minutes)
   + attacking points (xG/xA per-90, adjusted by opponent fixture difficulty)
   + defensive-contribution points (from CBIT/CBIRT per-90 rate)
   + clean-sheet points - expected-goals-conceded penalty (FDR-based)
   + save points (goalkeepers)
   + a small bonus-points estimate
```

Scoring constants are read live from the FPL API's own rules (`game_config`),
not hardcoded, so an in-season rule tweak doesn't silently break anything.
Every player's EV carries an uncertainty band and the top 3 factors behind
it. See `engine/model.py` for the full, commented implementation.

This is a heuristic v1, not a trained model - it's expected to be tuned
in-season as its real error is logged and compared against public benchmarks
(the open [OpenFPL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09992) project reports
~1.2-2.0 RMSE per player-gameweek for public-data models, which is the
target range).

## Squad optimisation

`engine/optimise.py` uses [PuLP](https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/) with the
free, open-source CBC solver to pick the highest-EV 15-man squad within
budget, position and per-club constraints, then the best starting XI,
captain and vice-captain from within it.

## Running locally

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m engine.pipeline        # writes /data/*.json

cd app
npm install
npm run dev                      # app reads /data via a symlink in app/public
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Initial-squad picker (EV model + optimiser + pitch-view PWA)
- [ ] Team-ID tracking: transfers made, chips used, bank, rank history
- [ ] Transfer suggestion engine (multi-gameweek, factoring in hits/chips)
- [ ] Prediction-accuracy page (logged RMSE/MAE vs. actual results)
- [ ] Expected-minutes refinement using in-season rolling data
- [ ] Optional: FPL account token auth for pre-deadline squad sync
